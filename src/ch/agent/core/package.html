Provides general implementation support to any project.
This is currently a small package providing a standard for messages and exceptions. 
Messages within a category (a project, for example) have a unique key, 
and exceptions include a keyed message instead of a bare text string. 
Keyed exceptions avoid to have many exceptions types in projects making heavy 
use of exceptions.
