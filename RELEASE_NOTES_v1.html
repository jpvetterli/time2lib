<h2>ABOUT VERSION NUMBERS</h2>
Version numbers are in 3 parts: a major, a medium, and a minor number.
The major number is incremented very rarely, when the software is
modified in such a way that clients using it need to be recoded or even 
redesigned. The medium number is incremented when modifications break 
backward compatibility. For all other modifications, only the minor 
number is incremented.

<h3>Version 1.1.0 &mdash; Null elements forbidden unless they represent a missing value</h3>
There is now a consistently enforced rule that elements of time series cannot be 
null unless null has been defined to represent missing values. The rule is not new,
but its implementation has been cleaned up.
<p>
The new version of the library includes
modifications in TimeIndexable and RegularTimeSeries which are not backward compatible.
These changes are highlighted below.
<p>
Various pieces of javadoc comment have been updated.
